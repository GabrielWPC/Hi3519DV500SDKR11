Run step:
1. Run ./sample_quick_start 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
2. Exit the sample after AE is stable and prinf parameter of AE.
3. Run the sample with the last parameter of AE.
4. Observe the exposure effect.

Attention:
1.The gain and the exposure must correspond.
2.The exposure should correspond to the environment, and AE is stable in first three frames.
